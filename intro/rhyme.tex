		\bigskip

		A wondrous thing, \\
		and beautiful, \\
		'tis to write, \\
		a book. \\
		\bigskip

		I'd like to sing, \\
		of the sweat, \\
		the blood and tear, \\
		which it also took. \\
		\bigskip

		It started back in, \\
		nineteen-ninety-two, \\
		when users whined, \\
		"<we can nothing do!"> \\
		\bigskip

		They wanted to know, \\
		what their problem was, \\
		and how to fix it \\
		(by yesterday). \\
		\bigskip

		We put the answers in, \\
		a Linux f-a-q, \\
		hoped to get away, \\
		from any more writin'. \\
		\bigskip

		"<That's too long, \\
		it's hard to search, \\
		and we don't read it, \\
		any-which-way!"> \\
		\bigskip

		Then a few of us, \\
		joined together \\
		(virtually, you know), \\
		to start the LDP. \\

		\newpage
		{\normalsize {}}

		\bigskip
		We started to write, \\
		or plan, at least, \\
		several books, \\
		one for every need. \\
		\bigskip

		The start was fun, \\
		a lot of talk, \\
		an outline, \\
		then a slew. \\
		\bigskip

		Then silence came,\\
		the work began,\\
		some wrote less,\\
		others more. \\
		\bigskip

		A blank screen,\\
		oh its horrible,\\
		it sits there,\\
		laughs in the face. \\
		\bigskip

		We still await,\\
		the final day,\\
		when everything,\\
		will be done. \\
		\bigskip

		Until then,\\
		all we have,\\
		is a draft,\\
		for you to comment on.
