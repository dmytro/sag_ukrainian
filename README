This file should be called TODO, not README. It's just my
electronic notebook for the SAG.

To do for 1.0:

	- explain a little bit of Unix history?
	- do the index
	- do appendices
	- chapter quotes for all chapters
	- make tables come out as HTML tables or <pre>, not gifs
	- fix formatting and other problems
	
To do some other time:

	- write chapters on printing, security, emergencies

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other things:

bring back "root hats and the feeling or power"

UNIX -> Unix

Include formatted stuff in the source package (at least formatted versions
of .fig files).

Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick 
to anger.  Do not meddle in the affairs of dragons for you are crunchy 
and taste good with ketchup.  Do not meddle in the affairs of cats, for 
they are subtle and will piss on your computer.

usable vs useable: consistent

different than -> different from ?

how do shared libraries (ELF style) work?


Quidquid latine dictum sit, altum viditur.
(Whatever is said in Latin sounds profound.)

Do not meddle in the affairs of system daemons, because they are
many and your system is toast.

If they don't know what you're doing, they don't know what
you're doing wrong.
