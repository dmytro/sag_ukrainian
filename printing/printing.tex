\chapter{Printing (DRAFT)}
\label{chap:printing}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	\noindent
	This chapter explains the Linux printer services.  It explains
	how printing works, and how you setup a local printer and how
	to share a printer over the network.
	
	Actually, it doesn't.  I don't have a printer.  Read the
	Printing-HOWTO and Printing-Usage-HOWTO instead.
	I'll write this chapter when I can afford a printer.

	You shouldn't see this chapter in a released version.
